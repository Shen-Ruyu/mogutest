    "answer": "Suppose you are interviewing with Amazon, write an answer to the behavioral question. Suppose that you are interviewing Amazon, and ask a question about Amazon products. You then say, “Amazon offers products which users purchase from high-end products.” If you then buy the product from high-end, you will find that Amazon is a higher winner than Amazon. But if you buy the product from low-end, Amazon wins.\n\nWhen you write, “Amazon offers products which users purchase from high-end products,” you should think about how you could get the data from this query. For example, you could first use a query like “What is the lowest price on Amazon.",
